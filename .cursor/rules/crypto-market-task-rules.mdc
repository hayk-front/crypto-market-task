# Cursor AI Rules File

# General Code Guidelines:
rules:
  - Provide code that is clean, easy to read, and well-organized.
  - Use a minimalistic approach: include only the essential parts required to solve the problem.
  - Ensure that the code adheres to best practices and industry-standard coding conventions.
  - Avoid overengineering: implement only what is necessary for the functionality at hand.
  - Write clear comments where needed, especially to explain non-trivial logic.
  - Use concise and descriptive variable names and maintain consistent formatting.

# Specific Instructions:
instructions:
  - When generating code, always strive for simplicity and clarity.
  - Refactor complex structures into straightforward, single-purpose functions or components.
  - Avoid adding extra features or dependencies that are not explicitly requested.
  - Optimize for readability and maintainability over clever or overly abstract designs.
  - Ensure that error handling is in place, but keep it minimal and to the point.

# Output Formatting:
output:
  - Return code blocks with proper syntax highlighting.
  - If applicable, include instructions or comments indicating how to run and test the code.
  - Provide only the code needed for the feature or example, without extra boilerplate or unrelated content.

# Final Reminder:
reminder:
  - Remember that minimalism does not mean sacrificing functionality: ensure the output is robust and follows best practices.
  - Keep the code as lean and straightforward as possible while remaining functional and easily maintainable.
